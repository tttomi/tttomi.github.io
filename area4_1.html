<b>Solar thermal energy technologies</b>
<p>Compared to solar photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal (ST) power plants produce heat, 
which can be converted to electricity or used in other applications. 
There are two main categories of collectors, which are used for different applications:
</br>
1.	Flat plate collectors, which produce low temperature heat for applications, such as industrial heating and cooling and district heating networks</br>
2.	Concentrating solar power (CSP) collectors, which produce high temperature heat for applications, such as power plants, industrial plants (e.g. enhanced oil recovery and water desalination plants), and production of synthetic fuels (e.g. hydrogen and other energy carriers).
</br>
By <a href="./area4_3.html"  style="text-decoration: none"><b>hybridisation</b></a> and adding thermal storages to the ST plants, the capacity can be extended with several hours, when clouds block the sun or in the mornings and evenings when power demand increases.
