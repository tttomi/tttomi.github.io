<b>Why hybridisation?</b>
<p>Hybridisation of solar energy together with another energy source is one option
to provide heat and power reliably on demand. Concentrated solar power (CSP) and conventional
solid fuel-fired hybrid power plants are one of the possible technical solutions in order to increase
the share of renewable energy (RE) and to decrease greenhouse gas emission levels and fuel consumption
of conventional solid fuel-fired power plants. In addition, the system efficiency can be improved, the costs
of CSP technology can be lowered and the operation time-frame and market areas for CSP technology can be extended. 
</p>

<b>What is COMBO-CFB project?</b>
<p> The research project &quot;Combination of Concentrated Solar Power CSP and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) Power Plants&quot;
(COMBO-CFB) has been carried out to develop innovative, flexible and high-efficient hybrid concept,
which is required to be flexible in operation while utilizing the joint infrastructure and balancing
the distributed intermittent power production.  In the project, different technologies and know-how with strong
industrial contribution on research were brought together to ensure the performance of the novel hybrid concept.

As a result, the COMBO-CFB provided new valuable experimental data and knowhow about dynamic behaviour
of CFB combustion under boundary conditions of the hybrid system. Dynamic modelling was used to analyse
the effects of different hybridization schemes and to define and compare the main performance figures. 
Research on combustion dynamics includes test sets for a pilot-scale CFB boiler, in which the combustion behaviour
was studied during rapid load changes typical for CSP hybrid system.
