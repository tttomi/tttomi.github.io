The project developed and demonstrated a power plant concept that allows flexible high-efficiency
air-firing of fossil fuels with biomass and oxygen-firing with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
which provides the potential for an almost 100% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>.
The use of the Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) technology allows the utilization of indigenous coals
and biomass with CCS thus addressing the needs for climate change mitigation, security of supply and reduction
of dependence on imported fuels.

<p>
The primary novelty of the proposed technology is in the full utilisation of all of the
new CFB design and process advancements when merging a CFB boiler with a supercritical
once through steam cycle and air separation unit together with CO<sub>2</sub> capture unit for CCS.

<ul>
<li>
A successful demonstration test campaign was carried out to confirm
that Flexi-Burn CFB concept is a reliable, controllable, safe and feasible
technology to address the CCS challenge
</li>
</br>
<li>
New simulation tools were developed to support the development of
Flexi-Burn CFB concept based on elementary knowledge and
experimental data from pilot plants and the commercial-scale field measurements
</li>
</br>
<li>
Readiness to start engineering of a commercial scale demonstration of an air / oxy
flexible CFB power plant with CCS that is applicable to various local conditions
within the EU was created as a main result of the Flexi-Burn CFB project
