VTT has three pilot-scale combustors in Jyv&aumlskyl&auml:
</a>
<a id="textbox2">
<ul>
<li> a 20 kW reactor to simulate bubbling bed combustion</li>
<li> a 50 kW reactor to simulate circulating fluidised bed combustion</li>
<li> a 100 kW reactor to simulate grate combustion</li>
</ul>
</a>

<a id="textbox3">

<p> The scaling up of the pilot-scale results to power plant level is 
based on realistic temperature vs. residence time history in the furnace, 
realistic feeding of combustion air with several stages and inert wall materials.
</p>

<p>In addition to the reactors, versatile sampling and analysis systems 
are necessary for research of problems pertaining to furnaces and combustion 
of biomass and waste (ash melting, slagging, fouling and corrosion). 
VTT has unique probes for flue gas, aerosol fly ash and condensed vapour analysis.
With pilot-scale studies, the solution of corrosive problems can become 1-2 magnitudes 
cheaper than repairing and paying the power plant damages.</p>
 
<p>With this infrastructure, VTT has participated to product development
 and combustion problem solution work with numerous companies, 
 in EU funded and domestic network projects. For example, mixtures of different
 coals with risky biomass were optimised by circulating fluidised bed and bubbling bed.
 In addition, mixtures of wood and agro biomass were optimised with grate combustor.
 Furthermore, additives to prevent corrosive attach against superheaters were developed
 with bubbling bed reactor and with grate combustor.</p>
