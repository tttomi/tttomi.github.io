<b>Neo-Carbon Energy</b> project is one of the Tekes&apos;	 &ndash;	
the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation &ndash; strategic research openings. 
The project is carried out in cooperation with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, 
Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) and Finland Futures Research Centre (FFRC) at University of Turku.
<p> Neo-Carbon Energy&apos;s solution is an entirely new energy system based on solar and wind alongside other 
renewables such as hydro power, geothermal and sustainable biomass. The system will produce energy
that is emission-free, cost-effective and independent.
</p>
<p>The transition to a renewable energy system must begin now to limit global warming to 2&deg;C. 
To stay on track towards this target annual global GHG emission must peak around 2020 and be halved
from the current by 2040.
</p>

In the foreseen future the energy system is likely to still need hydrocarbons for various purposes.
Fuels, chemicals and materials can be used in transportation and manufacturing industry also in the emission 
free future if we use CO<sub>2</sub> captured from air as a source of carbon. 
This re-thinking of carbon is in the heart of neo-carbonisation.
