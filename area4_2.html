<b>What are bioenergy RES hybrids?</b>
<p> Bioenergy RES hybrid is considered as a process with at least two different renewable energy inputs,
of which one is bioenergy. Bioenergy is a storable source of energy, of which energy can be produced on
demand unlike in most of the solar and wind power plants. With bioenergy RES hybrids, 
the dependency on purchase prices of electricity and fossil fuels can be decreased
and the level of self-sufficiency can be increased. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, different energy sources can be exploited at their best, 
which can lower the cost of energy and improve system efficiency with respect to using only one energy source. 
For example, solar thermal is not available during the winter period without a large-scale thermal storage system,
whereas biomass can be used with high capacity factor and efficiency. In some situations,
hybrid system can even reduce the work load of the system owner/operator and improve the component lifetime.

<b>Why bioenergy RES hybrids?</b>
<p> The variable renewable energy production (e.g. solar electricity, solar thermal and wind)
creates need for new flexible energy production balancing the system and for energy storage solutions.
Energy systems become more complex, since they rely more and more on distributed renewable generation
instead of traditional centralized production and different energy sectors are integrated. 
</p>
<p>In order to increase the share of renewable energy and decrease greenhouse gas emissions
while simultaneously guaranteeing reliable energy delivery with sufficient price,
a combination of different technologies is needed. Bioenergy RES hybrids in different applications 
and scales are part of the solution to respond to challenges in the energy system.
Hybrid systems having bioenergy as one component are flexible in the sense of being able
to produce both base load and balancing services.
