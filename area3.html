The objective for the Carbon Capture and Storage Program (CCSP) is to develop CCS-related
technologies and concepts, leading to essential pilots and demonstrations by the end of the program.
A further objective is to create a strong scientific basis for the development of CCS technology, 
concepts and frameworks, and to establish active, international CCS co-operation.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS; CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration)
is considered to be one of the main options for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions alongside renewable energy, 
more efficient energy use and nuclear power. The concept of CCS includes separation of CO2 produced
by an industrial or energy-related source (referred to as CO<sub>2</sub>  capture), transportation of CO<sub>2</sub> to a 
suitable storage location, and permanent storage of CO<sub>2</sub>  in isolation from the atmosphere. 
CCS could significantly reduce current CO<sub>2</sub> emissions already in a relatively short time frame (10-20 years).

The main research areas are: 
<ul>
<li><b>CCS concepts and technologies:</b> Solution for combined heat and power plants, multi-fuel power plants, Bio-CCS...</li>
<li><b>Monitoring technology:</b> Development of methods and technology for monitoring of CO2 capture and storage</li>
<li><b>Framework for CCS:</b> Regulation, sustainability and public acceptance of CCS. </li>
<li><b>CO2 utilization:</b> CO2 as a feedstock in industrial processes, CO2 capture by algae cultivation</li>
</ul>
