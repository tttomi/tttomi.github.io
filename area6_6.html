<ul>
	<li>The work includes development of an Apros simulation model from the evaporators of the studied recovery boiler</li>
	<li>The simulation model includes the rear, front and side walls, floor and roof of the boiler, rear wall screen, boiler generating bank tubes, drum(s), feeders, risers and down comers for the furnace walls, extended side wall and boiler bank etc.</li>
	<li>The calculation is based on physical principles and empirical correlations and takes into account water/steam flows with related heat transfer from the furnace to the water circulation</li>
	<li>To ensure correct sizing of pipes and process the model is based on plant drawings and the detailed information provided by the client:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Plant drawings</li>
			<li>The dimensions used for the tubes, pipes, headers and drums of the simulation model</li>
			<li>Amount of the cyclones</li>
			<li>The heat flux and distributions</li>
			<li>The heat flux distribution in horizontal direction can be taken into account</li>
			<li>In the vertical direction the tubes have been also divided into portions and thus the heat flux distribution also in vertical direction is varying</li>
		</ul>
