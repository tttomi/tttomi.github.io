O2GEN aims <b>to demonstrate the concept of the 2nd generation oxyfuel combustion</b>
that reduces significantly the overall efficiency penalty of CO<sub>2</sub>
capture into power plants, from approximately 12 to 6 efficiency points. 
It is a big challenge to find ways to increase the efficiency of the processes involved
in CCS and thereby reducing the energy penalty. While the efficiency of conventional air-fired thermal 
power plants is typically 45%, the efficiency significantly reduces by 12% when the oxyfuel CCS components
are added to capture the CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p>O2GEN project focuses on one of the most important recommendations of the Zero Emission Platform&#39;s
(ZEP) report for the deployment of CCS in the European Union (EU): <b>the use of higher O<sub>2</sub> concentrations
in oxyfuel combustion reducing the flue gas recirculation and energy penalty</b>. The utilization of Circulating
Fluidized Bed (CFB) oxyfuel combustion enables the reduction of the size of the boiler and the efficiency penalty,
resulting in a more environmentally and economically attractive technology.
