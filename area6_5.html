Recovery boilers have two main sections: 

<ul type="1">
	<li><b>Furnace section</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>The mixture of fuel and air are combusted in the furnace section</li>
			<li>The furnace walls are constructed of vertical tubes set in the row</li>
			<li>The rows of the tubes which form the four furnace walls are connected to headers which are part of the water circulation circuit for the boiler</li>
			<li>Water rising in these wall tubes receives heat by radiation from the char bed and flames in the furnace</li>
			<li>The furnace walls can represent as much as one half of the heat transfer surface required to produce high pressure steam</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Convective heat transfer section</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>The mixture of fuel and air are combusted in the furnace section
			<li>In the upper furnace, the nose arch or bullnose is located on the rear wall of the furnace</li>
			<li>The convective heat transfer section consists of the superheater, boiler bank and economizer and may include a set of screen tubes</li>
			<li>Heat transfer from the gas to these tube banks is largely by convection, but radiation can contribute nearly half the heat transfer in the hottest part of this section</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
