Neo-Carbon Energy is about creating a new emission-free and reliable energy system. 
<b>In 2050 an emission-free energy system has to be in place.</b> 
This system will be based mainly on solar and wind, which will be the cheapest sources on energy by that time.

<p> Without subsidies for fossil fuels, renewables would be the cheapest forms of energy already today. 
Even with the subsidies for fossils renewables have become competitive in this decade and will be the cheapest option within the next decade. 
<b>This initiates a massive transition in the energy system.</b>

<p>Solar and wind energy are inflexible energy resources. 
They are variable and even intermittent in production. 
Therefore <b>the whole energy system needs to be built tolerant for these sources of energy.</b> 
We believe this can be made in a cost efficient way through so called bridging technologies or neocarbonisation and energy storages.

With the current emission rate <b>no CO<sub>2</sub> can be emitted to the atmosphere after 2035 
</b>if global warming is aimed at to be limited to the 2&deg;C.
Therefore there is a lot unburnable carbon in coal, oil and gas deposits.
When all energy using processes in a society need to be zero emitting they need to be made to use 
solar and wind energy. This happens directly electrification or indirectly.
