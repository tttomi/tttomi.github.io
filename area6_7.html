As a result from these calculation the most important parameters (e.g. recirculation numbers) are revealed to ensure feasibility and safety of the retrofit. VTT has developed systematic and well tested way to produce these calculations. We can include also dynamic changes of the process to the model to test load changes
</p>
<ul>
	<li>For the best practices water circulation studies should be done to reveal current operation point, planned operation point after retrofit and theoretical maximum capacity point. Calculations take into account water/steam flows with related heat transfer from the boiler to the water circulation. These ensure correct sizing of pipes and process.</li>
	<li>A steady-state simulation is performed with initial condition provided by client</li>	
	<li>As a result you can get:</li>
		<ul>	
			<li>When the steady state is achieved the upper drum water level and the drum pressure is pointed out</li>
			<li>The pressure and pressure drop between the inlet volumes of the drum and the rest of the drum
			<li>All circulation numbers for different parts of boiler (total flow divided by steam flow out from the drum)
			<li>Steam flow out of the drum</li>
			<li>Main, sidewall ext., and boiler bank downcomer flows </li>
			<li>Velocities of liquid and steam</li>
			<li>The steam/water volume fractions, flows, pressures, temperatures in different parts of boiler</li>
		</ul>
